# Getting Started

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This document will help you get your server setup and ready to get Shadow License System running on it!

:::warning[Reminders]
You must be doing this on a VPS or dedicated server, and keep in mind all install guides are for an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Linux VPS.
:::

Make sure that you have read through our [prerequisites](/shadowStore/install/prerequisites) to prevent any issues later on.\
And if you haven't already, make sure you have an [A record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/) on your domain pointed to the IP of your server.

Before we begin, lets make sure everything is up to date and you have curl installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

---

## Install Node.Js

[Node.Js](https://nodejs.org) is a very popular framework for Javascript used to manage many different types of applications. Shadow License System is one type of application that requires it to be run, and since Node.Js has many versions we will be using Node Package Manager (NVM) to ensure the correct version is installed and running on our system.

Install NVM and the correct Node.Js version:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

nvm install 23.1.0
```

You will likely need to reopen the console after installing NVM to actually be able to run the install command.\
If you want to see if it has installed and is running the correct node version (23.1), you can run: `node --version` in your console.

### Install Forever (Optional)

[Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) is a Node.Js package used to manage and run node applications. We will be using it to prevent download and auto-restart the application if a major error causes it to crash. It will also log all console outputs to a file.\
_This is optional as you can run the application without this or a different manager like PM2. It is up to you; however, this guide will assume you are using forever._

Globally install forever:

```bash
npm i -g forever
```

If you want to see if it worked, you can run `forever list` (this also will show any apps being managed by forever).

## Install Nginx

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/) is the program that we will use to route and proxy all Shadow License System so it properly appears to the world on your domain.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

You will be prompted to press `Y` while installing, do it.\
Once it is installed, you should be able to navigate to your servers IP and you will be met with the default nginx page (seen below).\
`http://server_IP`

![nginx_default](https://shadowdevs.com/img/showcase/nginx_default.png)\
If you see this, you've got nginx install correctly! _Congrats!_

## Installing Certbot

[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) will allow you to automatically issue and install SLL certificates onto your domains.

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

## MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is the database program which Shadow License System uses to store all its data. MongoDB is a JSON based database which makes it easy to read and understand.

### Install MongoDB

1. Import the public key

   1. From a terminal, install gnupg and curl if they are not already available:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install gnupg curl
   ```

   2. To import the MongoDB public GPG key, run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-8.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg \
   --dearmor
   ```

   <Tabs
   	defaultValue='Noble'
   	values={[
   		{ label: 'Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)', value: 'Noble' },
   		{ label: 'Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)', value: 'Jammy' },
   		{ label: 'Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)', value: 'Focal' },
   	]}
   >
   	<TabItem value='Noble'>
   		```bash 
         echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu noble/mongodb-org/8.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list
         ```
   	</TabItem>
   	<TabItem value='Focal'>
   		```bash 
         echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/8.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list
         ```
   	</TabItem>
   	<TabItem value='Jammy'>
   		```bash 
         echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/8.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list
         ```
   	</TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Create the list file
   1. Create the list file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list` for your version of Ubuntu.

3. Reload the package database

   1. Issue the following command to reload the local package database:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

4. Install MongoDB Community Server
   1. You can install the latest stable version of MongoDB.
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
   ```

### Run MongoDB

We will be using `systemd` to run and manage MongoDB. You may use `init` if you wish, but this guide will not teach that.

1. Start MongoDB
   1. You can start the `mongod` process by issuing the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```
   
   2. If you receive an error similar to the following when starting `mongod`: 
   `Failed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found.`
   Run this command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

   Then run the start command again.

2. Verify that MongoDB has started successfully
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```

3. Ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   ```
