# Shopify Bot

This is the official documentation for [Shopify Bot](https://shadowdevs.com/store/shopifybot). Here you can find information on how to install it and manage settings.

## FAQ

- What is required to host it?
  - This is a simple Discord.JS bot and NodeJS/ExpressJs web server, so you will need an environment to handle both. We recommend a simple Linux server.
  - "Bot Hosting" services may work, but we can not ensure it as we have a web server built in as well.
  - _Our friends over at [Nexus Hosting](https://billing.nexushosts.com/aff.php?aff=9) have wonderful hosting options._
- What Database is used?
  - MongoDB is the database used. You just need the database URL within your `.env`.
- How does linking work?
  - Linking is done via the `/link` command (Staff Version: `/link-customer`), which opens a web UI that has an email and order number input to link the accounts in the database.
- What do I do with a bug I found?
  - Please report it in the [Shadow Development Discord](https://shadowdevs.com/discord) or via our [Website Bug Report Form](https://shadowdevs.com/form/bug-report).
