# Prerequisites

:::info[Hosting Notice]
Shopify Bot is a Discord.JS and ExpressJS based application, so it requires a VPS or Dedicated server to operate. "Bot Hosting" plans, may work, but we can not guarantee it.
:::

With Shopify Bot being a Node.JS application utilizing Discord.JS and ExpressJS, this document covers the assets that are needed and recommended to run everything smoothly.

> Keep in mind all documentation for installation are designed around using an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Linux VPS. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar are likely to work just the same as well; however, we do not currently offer documentation for any other OS.

## What is needed?

- VPS or Dedicated Server (Linux/Ubuntu is recommended OS)
- Your own Domain (EX: `shadowdevs.com`) for the web server
- Discord Application for bot functionality
- MongoDB database for data storage

*These specs may vary depending on your bot usage, number of servers, and command frequency. These specs should be sufficient for most use cases.*
