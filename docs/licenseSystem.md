# License System

:::warning[Notice]
These documentation are still WIP.
:::

This is the official documentation for [Shadow License System](https://shadowdevs.com/store/licensesystem). Here you can find information on how to install it and manage settings.

## FAQ

- What is required to host it?
  - You need to have a VPS, as Shadow Store is a node application it will not work on "shared hosting" type plans. We recommend a Linux VPS.
  - _Our friends over at [Nexus Hosting](https://nexushosting.io/cloud) have wonderful hosting options._
- What Database is used?
  - MongoDB is the database used. You just need the database URL within your `.env`.
- Do I have to use Discord for login and logs?
  - Currently for login, yes Discord is the only option; however, this will change in the future!
  - For logs, no using them is up to you.
- Does this work with Shadow Store?
  - YES! The license system is designed to work with [Shadow Store](https://shadowdevs.com/store/shadowstore), and buying the full version gives access to the internal version as well.
- What do I do with a bug I found?
  - Please report it in the [Shadow Development Discord](https://shadowdevs.com/discord) or via our [Website Contact Form](https://shadowdevs.com/form/contactus).
