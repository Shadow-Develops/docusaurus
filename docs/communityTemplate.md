# Community Template

Welcome to the official documentation for [Community Template](https://shadowdevs.com/store/communitytemplate). This guide covers everything from installation and configuration to features and integrations.

## FAQ

- **What kind of server do I need?**
  - Community Template requires a VPS or dedicated server running Ubuntu 22.04+ LTS. Shared hosting will not work.

- **What login methods are supported?**
  - Email (magic code), Discord OAuth, Google OAuth, and Steam OpenID are all supported out of the box. Each can be enabled or disabled individually.

- **Can I customize the look and feel?**
  - Yes. The admin panel includes full control over the navbar, footer, home page sections, theme, and custom CSS. You can also create completely custom pages.

- **Is a license required?**
  - Yes. A valid license key from [shadowdevs.com](https://shadowdevs.com/license) is required. The application verifies the license on startup with a 72-hour grace period if the license server is temporarily unreachable.

- **Where do I get support?**
  - Join the [Shadow Development Discord](https://discord.gg/shadowdevs) or use our [Web Contact Page](https://shadowdevs.com/contactus) for support.
