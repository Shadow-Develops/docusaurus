# SPARK Vehicle Control

:::warning[Notice]
These documentation are still Work in Progress.
:::

This is the official documentation for [SPARK Vehicle Control](https://github.com/AgentBUB/spark). Here you can find information on how to install and configure it.

## About

We knew that most people loved the features of RLC, but having to install a custom build of LCV then RLC was annoying. Additionally, the configuration of vehicles was quite horrible within RLC, so we built out SPARK to solve those problems. Now, one resource with the features of LVC and RLC on top of some extra stuff spawned SPARK!

> A combination and overhaul of Luxart Vehicle Control v3 and the Redneck Lighting Controller to build one smooth resource. No longer does it require 2 different things to make RLC / LVC work together well, and the configuration is now so much easier to understand!

## FAQ

- Do I have to install any dependencies?
  - RageUI is a required resource for your server so that the menu can work. It is provided inside the SPARK files, [which you can find here](https://github.com/AgentBUB/spark/tree/main/dependencies).
- What vehicles can I use this on?
  - You can use SPARK with any non-ELS vehicle on FiveM. There is no restriction nor conflict with using other creator's vehicles.
  - We have designed the special SPARK features for Redneck's vehicles; however, you can use them on other's vehicles.
- Will you design extra features for other creators?
  - We have no plans to build out extra features for no one except Redneck currently.
- How do I report a bug or request a feature?
  - Head over to the [Github Issues tab on the SPARK repo](https://github.com/AgentBUB/spark/issues) and submit an issue with the respective tag. _There are templates for both as well._
  - We do also recommend [joining Redneck's Discord](https://discord.gg/redneckmods) to let us know you've submitted an issue.
- Does this have all LVC's features?
  - Yes, all the base LVC features are still present within SPARK; however, some have been modified or improved.
- Does this still have all of RLC's features?
  - Yes, all the features that RLC had are still present. We did modify and improve them and fix some bugs.

## Plugins

Currently all plugins can be found via the Luxart Vehicle Control v3 Plugin's Github, which you can find here: https://github.com/TrevorBarns/luxart-vehicle-control-extras/tree/master/Plugins
_We will not be providing documentation on plugins._
