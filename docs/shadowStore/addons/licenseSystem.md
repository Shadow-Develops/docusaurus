# License System

The License System is available in two versions:

- [External Version](https://shadowdevs.com/store/licensesystem) - Standalone system
- [Internal Version](https://shadowdevs.com/store/shadowstore-licensesystem) - Integrated with Shadow Store

## Activation

1. Purchase either version to receive your license key
2. Access your Shadow Store Admin Panel
3. Navigate to Integration > License System
4. Enter your license key
5. Define if force IP lock is enabled/disabled
6. Click save settings

Once activated, the License System enables the `/api/verify` endpoint for license verification. For detailed information about using this endpoint, see the [Verify API documentation](/shadowStore/api/verify).

## Features

The internal version is designed to work exclusively within Shadow Store, providing integrated license management capabilities.\
The external version comes with its own independent website for license management and automatically includes the internal version functionality, allowing you to use both systems seamlessly.
